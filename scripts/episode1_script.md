# Mini Heroes – Season 1, Episode 1

## Title: Captain Clean Helps Tommy Tidy His Room

# Scene 1: Tommy’s Messy Room

(Lights up. Toys are scattered everywhere, socks on the floor, papers piled up. Tommy is sitting in the middle of the mess, playing with a toy car.)

**Tommy:** (groans) Ughhh... I don’t feel like cleaning today. My room looks fine... sort of. (kicks socks aside)

(The pile of socks wiggles. Dustzilla slowly rises, covered in dust and clutter, with glowing messy eyes.)

Dustzilla: (deep, rumbling laugh) Mwahaha! That’s right, Tommy! Leave the mess. The bigger the mess, the stronger I grow!

**Tommy:** (gasps) Whoa! A... dust monster?!

## Scene 2: The Villain Appears

(Dustzilla stomps around, spreading more clutter.)

**Dustzilla:** Chaos is my favorite! Soon, you won’t even find your bed under all this mess!

**Tommy**: (backs away) Oh no! I knew I should’ve cleaned!

(Suddenly, sparkling music plays. A bright light shines. Captain Clean flies in with Sparkle the Bucket bouncing beside him.)

**Captain Clean:** Not so fast, Dustzilla! Where there’s a mess, there’s a hero ready to clean it up!

Sparkle the Bucket: (sniffs the air dramatically) Whew! This place smells like stinky socks and adventure!

(Tommy laughs nervously.)

## Scene 3: The Plan

**Tommy:** Captain Clean! Can you really help me?

**Captain Clean:** Of course, Tommy. Cleaning isn’t boring—it’s a superpower. Every item you put away makes you stronger and Dustzilla weaker.

**Sparkle the Bucket:** And don’t worry, I’ll keep you entertained. Why did the broom go to school? (beat) To sweep up knowledge! (giggles)

**Tommy:** (laughs) Okay, okay! Let’s do this.

## Scene 4: The Cleaning Battle

(Upbeat music starts. Tommy, Captain Clean, and Sparkle work together to tidy up. Each time Tommy puts something away, Dustzilla shrinks.)

**Tommy:** (picking up toys) Into the toy box you go!

**Dustzilla:** (shrinking) Nooo! My messy powers... are fading!

**Captain Clean:** (hands Tommy a shirt) Fold this, and you’ll finish him off!

**Tommy:** (folds shirt) Take that, Dustzilla!

**Dustzilla:** (collapsing into a tiny dust bunny) I...can’t...stand...tidiness! (poofs away)

## Scene 5: Victory & Lesson

(The room is now sparkling clean. Tommy looks around proudly.)

**Tommy:** Wow! My room looks amazing! I can actually see my floor again.

**Captain Clean:** (smiles) See, Tommy? A tidy space makes room for fun and adventure. Cleanliness is responsibility in action—and that’s what makes you a true hero.

**Sparkle the Bucket:** And now that it’s clean, we can throw a dance party! (starts spinning)

(All characters dance as cheerful music plays. Curtain closes.)

Narrator/Voice-over: And so, Tommy learned that keeping his room clean wasn’t just easy—it was fun, rewarding, and powerful. Responsibility is a superpower we all have!
